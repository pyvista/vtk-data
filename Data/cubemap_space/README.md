### Generating this Cubemap

These cubemaps were generated by downloading the 4k and 16k images from:
https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4851

Converting from exr to jpg with:

```py
import os
os.environ["OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR"]="1"

import numpy as np
import cv2
im=cv2.imread("starmap_2020_16k_gal.exr",-1)
im=im*65535//8  # or 64 for the 4k
im[im>65535]=65535

cv2.imwrite('starmap_2020_16k_gal.jpg', im, [int(cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY), 50])
```

And converting to a cubemap using:
