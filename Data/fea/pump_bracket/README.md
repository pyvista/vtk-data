#### Data Acquition and Reduction

The [pump bracket project](https://www.simscale.com/projects/STR/bracket/) contains a modal analysis of the bracket. The result dataset was downloaded and the resuting file structure was:

```
$ unzip Bracket-Frequency_Analysis-Run_1-SOLUTION_FIELDS.zip
$ ls -R Bracket-Frequency_Analysis-Run_1-SOLUTION_FIELDS
```

```

Since the geometry is identical between each run, it was possible to reduce the
zipped dataset size from 109 MB to 34 MB while improving the load speed with:

```py
import numpy as np
import pyvista as pv

# load the geometry
ugrid_base = pv.read('./sim_1/sim_1_0_0.vtu')
ugrid_base.points = ugrid_base.points.astype(np.float32)
ugrid_base.clear_data()

# populate the modal solution for each result
for ii in range(10):
    ugrid = pv.read(f'./sim_{ii}/sim_{ii}_0_0.vtu')
    ugrid_base[f'disp_{ii}'] = ugrid.point_data['displacement normalized'].astype(np.float32)

# save
ugrid_base.save('pump_bracket.vtk')

```

This file was subsequently zipped with:

```
zip pump_bracket.zip pump_bracket.vtk
```
